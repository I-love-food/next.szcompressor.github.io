  + 9:40 AM Training on existing compressors (SZ, LibPressio with ZFP, etc.) (1h20)
    + Overview (40 min)
    + Hands-on (40 min)
  + 11:00 AM A general introduction to the FZ project and the 3 different thrusts of the FZ project (programming interface and specific compressor generation, building of the compression module library, visualization, quality assessment, and optimization) (1h)
  + 12:00 PM Lunch
  + 1:00 PM A presentation of the FZ project progress so far and the next milestones (1h)
  + 2:00 PM A presentation of the different application domain requirements and constraints concerning lossy compression by the application attendees (1h30)
  + 3:30 PM Break
  + 4:00 PM (cont.) A presentation of the different application domain requirements and constraints concerning lossy compression by the application attendees (1h30)
  + 5:30 PM end of day one session
  + 7:00 PM Dinner
+ Day 2 (Feb 15)
  + 9:00 AM one-to-one break-out sessions with the application developers and users to collect (i) use case requirements concerning compression ratio, speed, and accuracy criteria, (ii) practical compression interface requirements, including APIs and I/O library integration, and shell command. (45min)
    + 5 groups (Franck will move from group to group):
      + Group application 1 lead: Robert
      + Group application 2 lead: Dingwen

      +  Group application 10 lead: Hanqi
  + 10:30 AM Break
  + 11:00 AM Hackathon sessions where multiple existing compression schemes will be tested for every application to identify relevant compression methods and gaps that could be addressed with lossy compressor customization (1h30)
  + 12:30 PM Lunch
  + 1:00 PM Preparation of the slides summarizing discussion/test results for every application
