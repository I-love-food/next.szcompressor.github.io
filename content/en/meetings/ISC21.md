The ISC Tutorials are interactive courses focusing on key topics of high performance computing, networking, storage, and data science. Renowned experts in their respective fields will give attendees a comprehensive introduction to the topic as well as providing a closer look at specific problems. Tutorials are encouraged to include a “hands-on” component to allow attendees to practice prepared materials.

The Tutorials will be held on Thursday, June 24, and on Friday, June 25, 2021.

The ISC 2021 Tutorials Committee is headed by Kevin Huck, University of Oregon, USA, with Kathryn Mohror, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, USA, as Deputy Chair.
