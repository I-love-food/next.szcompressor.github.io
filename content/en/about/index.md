  <p style="margin-left: 20px;">Franck Cappello is the director of the Joint-Laboratory on Extreme Scale Computing gathering six of the leading high-performance computing institutions in the world. He is a senior computer scientist at Argonne National Laboratory and an adjunct associate professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He is an expert in resilience and fault tolerance for scientific computing and data analytics. Recently he started investigating lossy compression for scientific datasets to respond to the pressing needs of scientist performing large-scale simulations and experiments. His contribution to this domain is one of the best lossy compressors for scientific datasets respecting user-set error bounds. He is a member of the editorial board of the IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Computing and of the ACM HPDC and IEEE CCGRID steering committees. He is a fellow of the IEEE.
